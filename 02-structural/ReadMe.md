Structural design pattern is a blueprint of how different objects and classes are combined together to form a bigger structure for achieving multiple goals altogether.

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies

It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways.
